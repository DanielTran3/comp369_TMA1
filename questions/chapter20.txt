Can fuzzy matrices be used without multiplying the input memberships? Why or why not?
*1 - No, it is absolutely necessary to multiply the input memberships.
2 -	Yes, but only after negating the matrix.
3 - Yes, it is possible using AND and OR operators, and then randomly selecting action for the active cell.
4 - Yes, it is possible using XOR and NOT operators after multiplying the matrix.
